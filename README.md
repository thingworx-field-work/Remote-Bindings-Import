# Remote-Bindings-Import
Building Block-based Accelerator to use for mass import of remote bindings of Thing Properties to Kepware Tags.  Leverages a templatized Tag Mapping CSV that can be edited and uploaded to a File Repository, then parsed and imported into your Thing Model via a prebuilt UI.  Reduces time and effort needed to manually configure remote bindings one at a time in Composer when adding new Things with many bound properties or new bound properties across multiple Things.
